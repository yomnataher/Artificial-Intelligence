âœ³ Our goal is Plant Disease Detection by using some of images for the plants and train the model so that he is able to identify plants and is also able to identify the type of disease that has afflicted them. ðŸš€

âœ³ The data set consists of pictures of plants with many fruits, some of which are healthy and some of which are afflicted with diseases. ðŸ“‘

âœ³ The Model : I used MobileNetV2 ðŸ’¹
âœ” Architecture: MobileNetV2 is based on an inverted residual structure, where the residual connections occur between the bottleneck layers. Unlike traditional residual models that use expanded representations in the input, MobileNetV2 employs lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer12.
âœ” Model Description: The architecture uses efficient networks optimized for speed and memory, with residual blocks. It is designed to strike a balance between performance and resource constraints, making it suitable for mobile applications. The model has been pre-trained on large-scale datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks1.
âœ” Usage in PyTorch.
âœ” Performance Metrics:
âš« Top-1 error: 28.12%
âš« Top-5 error: 9.71%

âœ³ The accuracy of our model is
ðŸ”´ Test Loss: 0.0241784
ðŸ”´ Test Accuracy: 0.9923
