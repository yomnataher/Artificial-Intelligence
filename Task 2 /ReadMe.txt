We have data and we want to build a model to teach this data to differentiate between lines, and here we will use data for numbers to learn by them and to be able to 
differentiate between them, whatever the shape of these numbers. 
Therefore, this learning will be on images. We will build a model for learning on these images, and the result will be with the best Accuracy.
